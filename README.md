# MMM-Blitzer

Module to display radar traps around

Based on atudo.net api / blitzer.de

After i found the blitzer.de HACS integration for HomeAssistant by [@timniklas](https://github.com/timniklas) i also wanted something simular for MagicMirrorÂ²
So he did the api stuff and i just had to look through it. Thanks for this.
